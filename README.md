# Stress Test Template for DSA and CP

Using this tool, you can easily debug your C++ code, and find out the test-case your code is failing.

It has two types:

<dl>
  <dt>Shell based (Using multiple file structure)</dt>
  <dd>This will require you to execute run.sh and the counter testcase will be generated. Make sure you have put your code in appropriate files.</dd>
  <dt>File based (Using single file structure)</dt>
  <dd>This will only require you to include the template. Write your code in appropriate functions, and testcase will be generated using stringStream.</dd>
</dl>

Please look into the directories, they are self explanatory.
